# debian-post.sh -- Debian post-installation script
#
# Usage: debian-post.sh
#
# This is a post-installation script to install some packages and setup
# the system the way I want it after a fresh Debian install from the
# netinst ISO.  However, since all the packages I want aren't available
# in the Debian repositories, some packages need to be manually
# installed:
