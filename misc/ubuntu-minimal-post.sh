# ubuntu-minimal-post.sh -- Ubuntu post-installation script
#
# Usage: ubuntu-minimal-post.sh
#
# This is a post-installation script to install some packages and setup
# the system the way I want it after a fresh Ubuntu install from the
# mini ISO.  However, since all the packages I want aren't available on
# the Ubuntu repositories, some packages need to be manually installed:
