# Mutt profile for local Postfix
#
# To use this profile you must have an MTA like Postfix running in your
# system.  I use this exclusively for managing local mail -- meaning you
# can send and receive email within the same computer.  This might seem
# useless, but I find it useful for sending myself system notifications
# or logs of cron jobs.
