# Mutt profile for SU mail.

# Update (2021-02-05):  Sometime in early 2021 Outlook transitioned to
# its own custom OAuth protocol for IMAP authentication, thus completing
# total vendor lock-in.  And Syracuse ITS grunts are completly oblivious
# to such things.  There are ways to get Outlook's OAuth2 to work with
# OfflineIMAP/msmtp, but they're too convoluted for my liking, so I no
# longer use Outlook with Mutt, and forward my Outlook messages to
# another account with saner protocols instead.

# Outlook automatically puts a copy of every sent mail in the "Sent" folder.
# If you set $copy, Mutt will also put a copy, leading to duplicate copies.
# Either way, you'll waste some bandwidth, so let Outlook do this.
