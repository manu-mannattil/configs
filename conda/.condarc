# channel locations. These override conda defaults, i.e., conda will
# search *only* the channels listed here, in the order given. Use "defaults" to
# automatically include all default channels. Non-url channels will be
# interpreted as binstar usernames (this can be changed by modifying the
# channel_alias key; see below).
