Since Firefox 57.0, Mozilla has made it cumbersome to add custom search
plugins to Firefox.  Simply copying the "searchplugins" directory to
your profile folder will not work.

To add a search plugin, go through the following steps:

1. Find the "global" search plugin directories.  On Ubuntu they are

     /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/searchplugins/locale/en-CA
     /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/searchplugins/locale/en-ZA
     /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/searchplugins/locale/en-US
     /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/searchplugins/locale/en-GB
     /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/searchplugins/common

2. Copy the custom search engine's XML file to one of the above
   directories (say the locale-agnostic "common" directory).

3. Close all instances of Firefox and delete the "search.json.mozlz4"
   file from your profile directory.

4. Restart Firefox and save the newly created "search.json.mozlz4" for
   posterity.
