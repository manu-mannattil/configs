Since Firefox 57.0, Mozilla has made it cumbersome to add custom search
plugins to Firefox.  Simply copying the "searchplugins" directory to
your profile folder will not work.

To add a search plugin, go through the following steps:

1. In Firefox, press F12 to open the developer toolbox.  In the settings
   menu (the gear icon in the top-right corner), check "Enable browser
   chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes," and close the developer
   toolbox.

2. Note the location of the custom .xml file (it should begin with
   file:///home/...)

3. Go to Settings -> Web Developer -> Browser Console.

4. In the Browser Console commandline, enter the following.

    Services.search.addEngine("<location of .xml file>", null, null, false);

   You'll probably see the value "undefined" after submitting the above.

5. This would result in the creation of a search.json.mozlz4 (an LZ4
   compressed JSON file with the details of the custom search engines)
   inside your profile folder.  Save this file for posterity.
