# Keyboard configuration file for the Linux console.
# Consult the keyboard(5) manual page for more.
#
# NOTE (2026-02-02): On a LUKS-encrypted system, this file wasn't read
# and XKBOPTIONS was ignored.  I had to run the following commands to
# get it working:
#
#   sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
#   sudo update-initramfs -u
#
# I'm not entirely sure why these commands are needed --
# dpkg-reconfigure just rewrites this file and initramfs should be
# irrelevant for a tty console that's setup after the filesystem gets
# decrypted.
