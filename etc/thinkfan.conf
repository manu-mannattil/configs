# Syntax
# ------
#
# (<level>, <low>, <high)
#
# <level> is the fan level to use (0-7 with thinkpad_acpi)
# <low> is the temperature at which to step down to the previous level
# <high> is the temperature at which to step up to the next level
# All numbers are integers.

# Find the type of thermal_zone before adding, e.g., on my P43s
# thermal_zone7 is the WiFi adapter:
#
#   $ cat /sys/devices/virtual/thermal/thermal_zone7/type
#   iwlwifi_1
#
# However, the WiFi module gets loaded in the end, after ThinkFan
# starts.  This causes ThinkFan to fail since it can't read
# thermal_zone7's temperature.
