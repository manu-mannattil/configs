# Cron rules
# ----------
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task.
#
#   <minute> <hour> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week> <command>
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for minute, hour,
# day of month, month, and day of week or use '*' in these fields.
#
#       field          allowed values
#       -----          --------------
#       minute         0-59
#       hour           0-23
#       day of month   1-31
#       month          1-12 (or names, see below)
#       day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
#
#   0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)

# Environment. Some programs, e.g., fstrim(1), are not in
