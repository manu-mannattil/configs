# Note that ~/.cvsignore doesn't allow comments (at least rsync doesn't
# allow it).  Therefore, rather than use this file directly, use:
#
#   grep -v '\(^#\|^$\)' .cvs_ignore | sort | uniq > ~/.cvsignore
#
# NOTE: This file is named .cvs_ignore instead of .cvsignore because
# rsync ignores files named .cvsignore by default, and I like to use
# rsync to make backups of my configuration files.
