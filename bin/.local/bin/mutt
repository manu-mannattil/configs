# When Mutt is called with the stdin set to /dev/null, Mutt
# sends the message without asking for confirmation, e.g.,
#
#   mutt 'mailto:mail@mail.zz?subject=test&body=hello' </dev/null
#
# This is annoying because some lousily written programs like
# Mathematica send feedback using xdg-open this way, and if Mutt is
# configured to handle the x-scheme-handler/mailto MIME-type, then
# messages are sent in the background without notifying the user.
# I managed to send some 20 messages to Wolfram this way.  The purpose
# of this wrapper script is to first check if the stdin is attached to
# a TTY and quit otherwise.
