# I want to limit the number of SpaceFM windows that are spawned, and
# when using i3 I want them on workspace 1.  The thing is that, if I'm
# not in workspace 1, on calling SpaceFM, for reasons I don't fully
# understand, a new window is created irrespective of the options, e.g.,
# --reuse-tabs, I supply.  To prevent this from happening, we check if
# both i3 and SpaceFM are running and if yes, we first switch to
# workspace 1 before launching SpaceFM.
if { pgrep -x i3 && pgrep -x spacefm; } >/dev/null 2>&1

# Always have just one window open.  We can always split that window
# within SpaceFM if needed.
