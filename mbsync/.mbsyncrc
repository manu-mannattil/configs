# 1. The trailing "/" is important in path.
#
# 2. A glob of * in patterns will synchronize INBOX and hence there's no
#    need to add a separate channel for INBOX.
#
# 3. Suppose a channel (e.g., account-sent) has been configured to
#    synchronize and map the name of a particular folder on the far side
#    with a folder on the near side (say "Sent Mail" <-> "sent").  In
#    addition to this, suppose a channel (e.g., account-all) has been
#    configured to fetch messages from all other folders.  Clearly, one
#    wouldn't want to synchronize the "Sent Mail" folder twice.
#    To do this the patterns !"Sent Mail" and !"sent" have to be added
#    to the patterns list in the account-all folder.  If either of these
#    patterns are missing, mbsync will complain about not being able to
#    find that folder on the far/near side.

# ----------

# To make Gmail work with mbsync better, I have set the following
# through the web interface (Settings -> Forwading POP/IMAP).
#
#  o  Keep "auto expunge" off and ask Gmail to wait for the client to
#     update the server.  If this is not set, Gmail does not delete the
#     message properly and it would still be accessible from the "All
#     Mail" folder.  I don't want that.
#
#  o  When a message is marked as deleted and expunged from the last
#     visible IMAP folder, delete the message immediately.
#
# It's also useful to disable syncing of the "All Mail" and "Starred"
# folders (and all internal Gmail folders beginning with [Gmail]).  The
# reason is that starring a message is equivalent to toggling its
# "important" flag (you do this by pressing "F" in Mutt).  But if you do
# that, Gmail will put a copy of the same message in the "Starred"
# folder as well.  This means that you'll have two copies of the same
# message.  Enabling "All Mail" in IMAP also does the same thing (i.e.,
# if you don't make use of Gmail's archival "features").
