Personal fork of the original snipmate [1] plugin with some changes in
function:

1. New commands :ResetSnippets, :ResetAllSnippets, :ReloadSnippets, and
   :ReloadAllSnippets to conveniently access functions of the same name.

2. C and C++ snippets are now treated differently.

3. New function QuickSnippet() to define snippets on the fly, e.g.,

    inoremap <silent> `/ <ESC>:call QuickSnippet('\frac{${1}}{${2}}${3}')<CR>i
