Personal fork of the original snipmate [1] plugin with some changes in
function:

1. New commands :ResetSnippets, :ResetAllSnippets, :ReloadSnippets, and
   :ReloadAllSnippets to conveniently access functions of the same name.

2. C and C++ snippets are now treated differently.

3. New function QuickSnippet() to define snippets that don't require tab
   activation, e.g.,

      :call QuickSnippet('`/', '\frac{${1}}{${2}}${3}')

   This way, typing `/ in insert mode will trigger the snippet without
   needing to press <tab>.
