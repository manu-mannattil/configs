# Paper Proofreading

## Overview

Systematically proofread an academic paper against five structured checks. Each
check scans the full paper and collects concrete, line-level findings.

Two modes are available:
- **Report mode** (default): produces a single prioritized written report
  organized by check, with a summary scorecard at the top.
- **Interactive mode**: presents issues one at a time, lets the user decide how
  to resolve each one, and applies edits directly to the source files.

This skill targets **LaTeX source files** as primary input. Plain-text and PDF
inputs are supported but yield less precise findings (line numbers will be
approximate or absent).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Finishing a draft and want a full systematic review before submission — use
  **report mode**
- Sitting down to actively fix a paper issue by issue — use **interactive
  mode**
- Returning to a paper after a break and want to catch consistency issues
- Preparing a revision and need to verify all issues flagged by reviewers are
  resolved

## Arguments

```
/proofread [path] [--check <id>] [--interactive]
```

- `path` — path to the paper's root `.tex` file or directory containing
  `.tex` files. Defaults to the current directory.
- `--check <id>` — run only a specific check. IDs: `intro`, `math-notation`,
  `figures`, `grammar`, `abbrev`. Omit to run all five.
- `--interactive` — enable interactive mode. Omit for report mode.

---

## Core Workflow

### Step 0: Collect Input Files

1. Resolve the input path. If a directory is given, find all `.tex` files
   recursively (`find . -name "*.tex"`).
2. Read all `.tex` files into memory. Note the root file (typically `main.tex`)
   for structure analysis.
3. Concatenate files in document order (follow `\input` and `\include` chains
   from the root) to produce a single logical document for cross-section
   checks.
4. If no `.tex` files are found, attempt to read a plain-text or PDF version
   and warn the user that line numbers will be absent.

### Check 1: Paper Structure

**Goal**: Verify that the abstract and introduction follow the expected
structure of an academic paper: clear problem motivation, gap identification,
proposed approach, quantitative results (abstract), explicit contributions, and
a section roadmap. Check that the related work is discussed correctly. Check
that the conclusion follows common guidelines.

#### 1.1 Check abstract structure

The abstract must follow this fixed four-part structure, in order:

1. **Motivate the problem** — why does this problem matter? Showing
   real-world relevance strongly recommended.
2. **Identify the gap** — what do existing approaches fail to do?
3. **State the proposed approach** — what does this paper do?
4. **Give key quantitative results** — at least one concrete number
   supporting the main claim.

- `[ERROR]` if any of the four parts is entirely absent. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the parts appear but are out of order (e.g., approach stated
  before gap). `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if no quantitative result is given (e.g., only qualitative claims
  like "significantly improves"). `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the abstract exceeds 150 words (typical conference limit; adjust
  if venue is known). `[HARD]`

#### 1.2 Check introduction structure

The introduction must contain, in roughly this order:

1. **Motivation** — a paragraph establishing why the problem is important and
   relevant. Showing real-world relevance strongly recommended.
2. **State of the art and gap** — a summary of related approaches and their
   shortcomings. The gap must be stated explicitly (e.g., "However, none of
   these methods...").
3. **Proposed approach** — a description of what this paper proposes and why
   it addresses the gap.
4. **Contribution list** — a very concrete list of explicit contributions.
5. **Section roadmap** — [OPTIONAL] a final paragraph describing the
   structure of the paper (see 1.3).

- `[ERROR]` if the contribution list is absent. `[MIX]`
- `[INFO]` if the section roadmap is absent. `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if the gap is not stated explicitly (related work is described but
  no "However,..." or equivalent contrast is made). `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the proposed approach is not re-stated in the introduction after
  the related work (it should appear both in the abstract and the
  introduction). `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the novelty of the work is not stated explicitly (e.g., "To the
  best of our knowledge, this is the first work to..."). `[VIBE]`
- `[INFO]` if the introduction order deviates significantly from the structure
  above. `[VIBE]`

#### 1.3 Check section roadmap

The last paragraph of the introduction should describe the structure of the
remainder of the paper.

- `[WARN]` if no roadmap paragraph is present in the introduction. `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if the roadmap references a section number or name that does not
  match the actual sections in the document (verify against `\section{}`
  commands). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if the roadmap uses future tense ("will be presented") instead of
  present tense ("is presented", "presents"). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if not all major sections are mentioned in the roadmap (every
  top-level `\section{}` except the introduction itself should appear). `[MIX]`
- `[INFO]` if the roadmap does not open with a standard linking phrase such as
  "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows" or "This paper is
  organized as follows". `[MIX]`

#### 1.4 Check problem statement

If the paper has a dedicated problem statement section or subsection:

- `[ERROR]` if the problem statement mentions the proposed solution (e.g., "we
  use a safety shield"). The problem statement must describe what needs to be
  solved, not how. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the problem statement includes implementation details that belong
  in the method section. `[VIBE]`

#### 1.5 Check related work structure

- `[ERROR]` if related work is organized chronologically rather than
  thematically by approach category. Each category must open with a clear topic
  sentence. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the related work section does not end with a gap statement that
  clearly identifies what prior methods cannot do and thus motivates the
  proposed work. `[VIBE]`
- `[ERROR]` if the related work section explicitly describes or evaluates the
  proposed method (e.g., "In contrast to prior work, our method does X").
  Related work discusses others' work only. `[VIBE]`

#### 1.6 Check experiments and hypotheses

- `[WARN]` if the experiments section does not state hypotheses explicitly
  before presenting results (e.g., "H1: ..., H2: ..."). Explicit hypotheses are
  a frequently recurring professor comment. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if a conclusion generalizes a result to "all cases" or "any
  environment" when the experiment only covered one or two settings. `[VIBE]`

#### 1.7 Check conclusions

- `[WARN]` if the conclusion does not explain why the results are better than
  prior work. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the conclusion does not reiterate the unique features of the
  approach. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the conclusion does not mention at least one key quantitative
  result. `[VIBE]`
- `[INFO]` if the conclusion introduces new content not discussed anywhere else
  in the paper. `[VIBE]`

#### 1.8 Check motivation scope

Motivation — establishing why the problem matters, why existing approaches
fall short, or why the task is challenging — belongs exclusively in the
introduction (and, briefly, the related work gap statement). Method sections
must describe *what* the approach does and *how* it works, not re-argue *why*
the problem is worth solving. Flag motivational content in the methodology
section(s) and experiment/result section(s):

- `[ERROR]` if a method paragraph opens with a sentence that re-states the
  problem motivation from the introduction (e.g., "Ensuring safety is critical
  in human-robot interaction because...", "Existing methods fail to
  handle..."). `[VIBE]`
- `[ERROR]` if a method paragraph introduces new motivation not present in the
  introduction — a reason the problem is hard or important that was not
  established earlier (e.g., "Another challenge is that sensors are noisy,
  which makes..."). `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if transitional sentences between subsections of the method
  re-introduce the gap or limitation of prior work (e.g., "Since prior methods
  cannot handle X, we instead..."). A single back-reference is acceptable;
  repeated gap re-statements across multiple method subsections are not.
  `[VIBE]`

---

### Check 2: Math Symbols and Notation

**Goal**: Verify that every math symbol is defined before first use, that
equations are properly integrated into the text, and that LaTeX notation
follows best practices.

#### 2.1 Collect all math symbols

Scan all math environments (`$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, `\[...\]`,
`equation`, `align`, `gather`, `multline`, and their starred variants) and
build a list of every distinct symbol used. A symbol is any single letter,
Greek letter, calligraphic/bold/hat/dot-decorated letter, or named operator
that carries semantic meaning (e.g., `x`, `\mathcal{X}`, `\boldsymbol{\theta}`,
`\hat{f}`, `\dot{x}`, `J`, `\pi`).

Exclude pure syntax tokens (`=`, `+`, `-`, `\leq`, `\in`, `\forall`, etc.) —
these do not require definition.

#### 2.2 Check symbol definitions

For each symbol, find its first use in document order.

- `[ERROR]` if a symbol is used in an equation or inline math before it is
  defined anywhere in the text. A definition is a prose statement of the form
  "where `X` is ..." or "let `X` denote ..." appearing in the same or an
  earlier paragraph, or a `where` clause immediately following the equation.
  `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if a symbol is used in a figure caption or table caption before it
  has been defined in the main text at that point in reading order. `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if a symbol is defined but never used. `[MIX]`
- `[INFO]` if the definition appears after the equation rather than before
  (post-equation `where` clauses are acceptable but pre-definition is
  preferred). `[MIX]`

**Subscripts and superscripts:**

Treat each distinct subscript and superscript as a symbol in its own right if
it carries semantic meaning (i.e., it is a variable or index, not a fixed label
like `\text{max}`). Examples of semantic indices: `i` in `x_i`, `t` in `s_t`,
`k` in `g^{(k)}`. Examples of non-semantic labels: `\text{max}`, `\text{ref}`,
`0` as a constant initializer.

For each semantic subscript/superscript:
- `[ERROR]` if the index is used but never defined in prose (e.g., `s_t`
  appears but `t` is never explained as the time step index). `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if a subscripted or superscripted symbol (e.g., `x_i`) is
  introduced without defining what the index ranges over (e.g., `i \in \{1,
  \ldots, N\}` or "for each joint `i`"). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if an index is defined but the corresponding indexed family of
  symbols is only used once (indexing may be unnecessary). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if the same index letter is used with different meanings in
  different parts of the paper (e.g., `i` denotes joint index in Section II but
  episode index in Section IV). Flag each such conflict with both locations.
  `[MIX]`

#### 2.3 Check symbol consistency

This check verifies that notation is globally coherent: the same symbol always
refers to the same concept, and the same concept is always referred to by the
same symbol.

**One symbol, one concept:**

Build a map from each symbol to all prose definitions found for it across the
document.
- `[ERROR]` if a symbol is defined to mean two different things in different
  parts of the paper (e.g., `x` is defined as "state" in Section II and as
  "position" in Section IV). Report both definition locations. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if a symbol is used in a context that is semantically inconsistent
  with its definition, even if not explicitly redefined (e.g., `t` defined as a
  continuous time variable but used as a discrete step index elsewhere).
  `[VIBE]`

**One concept, one symbol:**

Identify concept clusters: groups of symbols that appear to refer to the same
entity based on their prose definitions and surrounding context.
- `[WARN]` if two different symbols appear to refer to the same concept without
  explanation (e.g., "goal state" is written as `g` in one section and as `x_g`
  in another). Flag as a potential inconsistency for the author to confirm.
  `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if a concept is sometimes referred to by its symbol and sometimes by
  a synonymous term that suggests a different symbol could be used (e.g.,
  "target" and "goal" used interchangeably but only one has a symbol). `[VIBE]`

**Decoration consistency:**

Decorations (`\hat{}`, `\tilde{}`, `\bar{}`, `\boldsymbol{}`, `\mathcal{}`)
should carry consistent semantic meaning throughout the paper (e.g., `\hat{x}`
always means "estimated x", `\mathcal{X}` always means "set of x").
- `[WARN]` if the same decoration is applied to different base symbols with
  different semantic meanings (e.g., `\hat{x}` means "estimate" but `\hat{f}`
  means "learned function" where a different convention might be expected).
  `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if a concept that is decorated in one equation (e.g., `\hat{x}` for
  estimated state) appears without decoration in another equation where the
  estimated value is clearly intended. `[VIBE]`

#### 2.4 Check variables in text

Single-letter variables and all math symbols appearing inline in prose must be
wrapped in math mode.

- `[ERROR]` for any bare single letter used as a variable in prose without math
  delimiters, e.g., `the value of N` instead of `the value of $N$`. Use context
  to distinguish math variables from ordinary words — flag only when the
  letter clearly refers to a mathematical quantity. `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` for bare expressions like `t+1` or `x_i` outside math mode.
  `[HARD]`

#### 2.5 Check equation integration and punctuation

Equations must be part of the surrounding text flow and punctuated accordingly.

- `[ERROR]` if a displayed equation is not preceded by a colon, comma, or a
  sentence that flows into it grammatically. `[VIBE]`
- `[ERROR]` if a displayed equation is not followed by a punctuation mark
  (period, comma) where one is grammatically required by the surrounding
  sentence. `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if an equation label is referenced before the equation appears in
  the document (forward reference to an equation). `[MIX]`

#### 2.6 Check scalar, vector, matrix, and set notation

**Goal**: Identify the notation convention the paper uses for mathematical
types, then verify it is applied consistently to every symbol.

**Step 1 — Infer the convention**

Scan the document for symbols whose type can be determined unambiguously from
context. Use the following signals:

| Signal | Type inferred |
|--------|--------------|
| `$x \in \mathbb{R}$` (no exponent) | scalar |
| `$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$` (single exponent) | vector |
| `$x \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$` (product exponent) | matrix |
| `$x = \{...\}$`, `$x \subset ...$`, `$x \subseteq ...$` | set |
| Subscripted with two indices: `$A_{ij}$` | likely matrix |
| Subscripted with one index: `$x_i$` | likely vector element or scalar |
| `\mathcal{X}` | likely set (strong signal for Convention A) |
| `\boldsymbol{x}` lowercase | likely vector (strong signal for Convention A) |
| `\boldsymbol{X}` uppercase | matrix (A) or set (B) |
| `\mathbf{x}` | likely vector (Convention C) |

From these signals, determine which of the following conventions the paper most
likely follows. Choose the convention with the most matching evidence:

| Convention | Scalar | Vector | Matrix | Set |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-----|
|**A** (default)|`$x$`|`$\boldsymbol{x}$`|`$\boldsymbol{X}$`|`$\mathcal{X}$`|
| **B** | `$x$` | `$x$` (no bold) | `$X$` | `$\boldsymbol{X}$` |
| **C** (ML) | `$x$` | `$\mathbf{x}$` | `$\mathbf{X}$` | `$\mathcal{X}$` |

Report the detected convention at the top of Check 2's findings: `Detected
notation convention: A/B/C (or unknown)`.

If the evidence is mixed and no single convention dominates, report `[WARN]
Notation convention could not be determined reliably — mixed signals found`
and list the conflicting examples. Still proceed with the checks below using
the plurality convention.

**Step 2 — Check all typed symbols**

For each symbol whose type is known (from Step 1 signals or prose definitions),
verify its formatting matches the detected convention:

- `[ERROR]` if a known vector is not formatted as the convention requires
  (e.g., Convention A: vector `x` written as plain `$x$` instead of
  `$\boldsymbol{x}$`). `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if a known matrix is not formatted as the convention requires
  (e.g., Convention A: matrix `A` written as plain `$A$` instead of
  `$\boldsymbol{A}$`). `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if a known set is not formatted as the convention requires (e.g.,
  Convention A: set written as `$X$` instead of `$\mathcal{X}$`). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if a known scalar is formatted with bold or calligraphic style
  (likely a type error). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if a symbol's type cannot be determined but its formatting is
  inconsistent with other symbols of likely the same type. `[VIBE]`

**Step 3 — Check for mixed convention usage**

- `[ERROR]` if both `\boldsymbol{}` and `\mathbf{}` are used for vectors or
  matrices (only one bold command should be used throughout; `\boldsymbol{}` is
  preferred as it also works for Greek letters). `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if uppercase calligraphic (`\mathcal{}`) and uppercase bold
  (`\boldsymbol{}` or `\mathbf{}`) are both used for sets in different places.
  `[MIX]`

---

#### 2.7 Check notation best practices

- `[ERROR]` if `*` is used for multiplication inside math mode (use
  juxtaposition or `\cdot` instead): e.g., `$a * b$` → `$a b$` or `$a \cdot
  b$`. `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if `\cdot` is used to denote a dot product between two vectors
  (prefer the transpose form `$\boldsymbol{c}^\top \boldsymbol{c}$` instead):
  e.g., `$\boldsymbol{a} \cdot \boldsymbol{b}$` → `$\boldsymbol{a}^\top
  \boldsymbol{b}$`. `[HARD]`
- `[ERROR]` if plain text words appear inside a formula without `\text{}` or
  `\mathrm{}`, causing them to render as products of letters: e.g., `$sun$`
  instead of `$\text{sun}$`. Flag when a sequence of 3+ lowercase letters
  inside math mode spells an English word. `[HARD]`
- `[ERROR]` if `\mathbf` is used for Greek letters or symbols that should use
  `\boldsymbol` instead (e.g., `\mathbf{\theta}` → `\boldsymbol{\theta}`).
  `[HARD]`
- `[ERROR]` if an accent or decoration is placed outside rather than around
  only the base letter: e.g., `\hat{f(x)}` → `\hat{f}(x)`. `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if `\frac` is used inside inline math (`$...$`) where `\tfrac` or a
  slash form would be more readable. `[HARD]`
- `[ERROR]` if `\mathbb` is used for anything other than the standard number
  sets `\mathbb{R}`, `\mathbb{N}`, `\mathbb{Z}`, `\mathbb{C}`, `\mathbb{Q}`. It
  must not be used for general matrices, indicator functions, or other objects.
  `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if time derivatives are written as `\frac{d x}{d t}` or
  `\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}` in display equations where `\dot{x}` or
  `\ddot{x}` would be more compact and consistent with the rest of the paper.
  `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if an equation is referenced in prose as "equation 3" or "eq. 3"
  instead of `\eqref{label}`, which produces `(3)` automatically and tracks
  renumbering. `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if a multi-step derivation contains `=` or `\leq` transitions with
  no indication of which equation or rule was used. Suggest `\overset{(X)}{}`
  or a brief prose annotation to make the derivation checkable. `[VIBE]`
- `[ERROR]` if `\forall` or `\exists` is followed directly by a set (e.g.,
  `\forall \{a, b, c\}`) rather than a variable with a domain constraint (e.g.,
  `\forall x \in \mathcal{X}`). `[HARD]`
- `[INFO]` if "zero vector" is used; prefer "vector of zeros" (`\mathbf{0}`) to
  avoid confusion with the zero element of a vector space. `[HARD]`

#### 2.8 Check repeated math expressions and custom command usage

**Step 1 — Collect existing custom commands**

Scan the preamble and any `\input`-ted style or macro files for all custom math
command definitions:
- `\newcommand`, `\renewcommand`, `\providecommand`
- `\DeclareMathOperator`, `\DeclarePairedDelimiter`

For each defined command, record its name and its expansion (the replacement
text). Build a map: `expansion → command name`.

**Step 2 — Detect repeated complex expressions**

Scan all math environments and collect every sub-expression that is:
- Non-trivial: contains at least one subscript or superscript plus at least one
  `\text{}`, `\mathrm{}`, or decoration (`\hat`, `\boldsymbol`, etc.) — e.g.,
  `r_{\text{hum}}^j`, `\hat{x}_{t+1|t}`, `\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{ref}}`
- Not already covered by a custom command from Step 1

Count occurrences of each such expression across the full document (inline and
displayed math).

- `[INFO]` for any complex expression appearing **3 or more times** that has no
  corresponding custom command. For each, suggest a concise command name and
  the `\newcommand` definition: `[MIX]`
``` Expression `r_{\text{hum}}^j` appears 7 times. Suggestion:
\newcommand{\rhumj}{r_{\text{hum}}^j} ``` Propose the command name by combining
the meaningful parts of the expression (drop `\text`, `\boldsymbol`, braces;
camelCase or abbreviate). Flag this as `[INFO]` since it is a style suggestion,
not an error.

**Step 3 — Check consistent use of existing custom commands**

For each custom command defined in Step 1, search all math environments for
occurrences of its expansion written out in full instead of using the command.

- `[WARN]` if a defined command's expansion appears written out manually
  instead of using the command: e.g., `r_{\text{hum}}^j` is written out
  explicitly when `\rhumj` is already defined. `[HARD]`
``` [WARN] main.tex:84 — expansion of \rhumj written out manually instead of
using the command. > $r_{\text{hum}}^j \leq d_{\text{safe}}$ Suggestion:
Replace with \rhumj. ```

#### 2.9 Check notation coherence

- `[ERROR]` if the paper switches between discrete and continuous time notation
  without explicitly explaining the relationship. For example, using `t_k` for
  discrete steps in one section and `t` for continuous time in another without
  a bridging statement. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if the same mathematical operation is written two different ways in
  different parts of the paper (e.g., `\| \cdot \|` vs `| \cdot |` for the same
  norm, or `a^\top b` vs `\langle a, b \rangle` for the same inner product).
  `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if the same quantity is denoted differently across sections or the
  appendix (e.g., `q_i` in the main text vs `\theta_i` in the appendix for
  joint angles). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if subscripts and superscripts for the same concept are used
  inconsistently (e.g., `x_i^j` in one place and `x^j_i` or `x_{i,j}` elsewhere
  for the same meaning). `[MIX]`

#### 2.10 Check equation numbering discipline

- `[INFO]` if a numbered equation is never referenced anywhere in the text. An
  unreferenced equation number adds clutter; suggest removing the number (use
  the starred environment, e.g., `equation*`). `[HARD]`
- `[INFO]` if an equation `\label{}` is defined but no corresponding
  `\eqref{label}` or `\ref{label}` is used. `[HARD]`

#### 2.11 Check function argument consistency

- `[ERROR]` if a function is called with different numbers of arguments at
  different points (e.g., `f(x)` in one place and `f(x, t)` elsewhere without
  explanation). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if a function is defined with arguments in one order but called in a
  different order at a later use. `[VIBE]`

---

### Check 3: Figures and Tables

**Goal**: Verify that every figure and table is referenced in the text, has a
self-contained caption, uses vector graphics, and is placed close to its first
reference.

#### 3.1 Check that every figure and table is referenced

Collect all figure and table labels from `\label{}` commands inside `figure`
and `table` environments. Collect all references to figures and tables from
`\ref{}`, `\cref{}`, `\autoref{}`, and `\Cref{}` commands in the body text.

- `[ERROR]` if a figure or table has a `\label{}` but is never referenced in
  the body text. `[HARD]`
- `[ERROR]` if a figure or table is referenced but has no `\label{}` (hardcoded
  number used directly). `[HARD]`
- `[ERROR]` if a figure or table is referenced only in its own caption
  (self-referential, not referenced from body text). `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if a figure is referenced only after its position in the document
  (i.e., the first `\ref{}`/`\autoref{}` to that figure appears textually after
  the `\begin{figure}`). Figures should be mentioned before or at the point
  where the reader encounters them. `[MIX]`
- `[INFO]` if a figure is referenced only once in the entire document; verify
  the call-out is early enough. `[MIX]`

#### 3.2 Check that every reference points to an existing label

- `[ERROR]` if a `\ref{}`, `\cref{}`, or similar command references a label
  that does not exist in the document (dangling reference). `[HARD]`

#### 3.3 Check caption quality

Every figure and table caption must be self-contained: a reader should
understand what is shown without reading the surrounding text.

- `[ERROR]` if a caption is a single word or fragment (e.g.,
  `\caption{Results.}`) — captions should describe what is shown. `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if a figure uses visual elements (line styles, colors, arrow
  styles, shading) that are not explained in the caption or a legend within the
  figure. For example, if both solid and dashed lines appear, the caption must
  state what each represents. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if a caption says only "Results of experiment X" without describing
  what the axes, curves, or visual elements represent. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if a caption uses an abbreviation that is not introduced either
  within the caption itself or in the document before the figure/table appears
  in reading order. `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if a caption uses a math symbol that is not defined within the
  caption and has not been defined in the main text before this point. `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if a caption ends without a period. `[HARD]`

#### 3.4 Check that figures are referenced before they appear

Figures and tables should appear close to and after their first reference in
the text.

- `[WARN]` if a figure or table appears in the document more than one page
  before its first in-text reference (forward float that readers encounter
  before the motivation). `[MIX]`
- `[INFO]` if a figure or table appears more than two pages after its first
  reference (may have drifted too far). `[MIX]`

#### 3.5 Check figure format

- `[WARN]` if a figure is included using a raster format (`.png`, `.jpg`,
  `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.gif`) — prefer vector formats (`.pdf`, `.eps`, `.svg`).
  Raster figures lose quality when scaled and are generally not accepted by
  IEEE/ACM venues for line art and diagrams. `[HARD]`
- `[INFO]` if a figure file cannot be located on disk (broken include path).
  `[HARD]`

#### 3.6 Check that figures are explained in the text

Every figure and table should be discussed in the surrounding text, not just
referenced.

- `[WARN]` if a figure or table reference appears in the text but the
  surrounding paragraph contains no sentence that describes or interprets what
  the figure/table shows (i.e., the reference is a bare parenthetical like
  "(see Fig. 3)" with no accompanying explanation). `[VIBE]`

#### 3.7 Check cross-figure connections

- `[WARN]` if two figures use the same symbol, trajectory, or visual element
  where a connection between them would help the reader, but no explicit
  cross-reference exists in the text or captions. For example, if Fig. 4 shows
  a trajectory that was first introduced in Fig. 3, the caption of Fig. 4
  should say so. `[VIBE]`

---

### Check 4: Grammar and Style

**Goal**: Verify that the paper follows consistent grammatical conventions,
uses the correct voice and tense, applies English punctuation rules correctly,
and avoids known stylistic anti-patterns.

#### 4.1 Voice and person

- `[ERROR]` if first-person singular "I" is used anywhere (use "we" or passive
  voice instead). `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if passive voice is used in a context where "we" would work
  naturally (e.g., "It is shown that..." → "We show that..."). Passive is
  acceptable only when describing system or environmental properties (e.g.,
  "The robot is mounted on a table"). `[VIBE]`
- `[INFO]` if "we" is used to describe a system or environment property where
  passive would be more appropriate (e.g., "We mount the robot on a table" when
  describing a fixed experimental setup). `[VIBE]`

#### 4.2 Tense consistency

**Main body**: use present tense throughout.
- `[WARN]` if past tense is used in the main body outside of the related work
  section (e.g., "We proposed a method" → "We propose a method"). `[MIX]`

**Figures and tables**: always referenced in present tense.
- `[ERROR]` if a figure or table is referenced in past or future tense (e.g.,
  "Fig. 3 showed..." → "Fig. 3 shows...", "Table 1 will present..." →
  "Table 1 presents..."). `[MIX]`

**Related work section**: tense depends on intent.
- Simple past for describing results of a published work: "Smith [1] found
  that..."
- Present for author's own evaluation of the literature: "This approach,
  however, fails to..."
- Present perfect for recent or ongoing relevance: "Recent work has shown
  [7]..."
- `[WARN]` if only one tense is used throughout the entire related work section
  (likely indicates mechanical rather than intentional tense choice). `[VIBE]`

#### 4.3 English variant consistency

Detect the dominant English variant used in the paper (American or British) by
scanning for known variant-specific spellings:

| Feature | American | British |
|---------|----------|---------|
| `-or` / `-our` | behavior | behaviour |
| `-er` / `-re` | center | centre |
| `-ize` / `-ise` | analyze | analyse |
| Double consonant | modeled | modelled |

- `[ERROR]` if both variants are used (e.g., "behaviour" and "center" in the
  same paper). Report all deviations from the dominant variant. `[HARD]`
- `[INFO]` state which variant was detected at the top of the Check 4 findings.
  `[HARD]`

#### 4.4 Punctuation

**Oxford comma**: use a comma before the final conjunction in a list of three
or more items.
- `[ERROR]` if a list of three or more items is missing the Oxford comma (e.g.,
  "We present results, discussion and conclusion" → "... discussion, and
  conclusion"). `[VIBE]`

**Comma after i.e. and e.g.**:
- `[ERROR]` if "i.e." or "e.g." is not followed by a comma (e.g., "i.e. the
  result" → "i.e., the result"). `[HARD]`

**Em-dashes**: avoid em-dashes (`---`, `\textemdash`, `—`). Use a comma or
split the sentence instead.
- `[WARN]` for every em-dash found. Suggest a comma or sentence split as the
  fix. `[HARD]`

**Comma with "which"**: use a comma before "which" when the clause is
non-restrictive (i.e., the sentence is understandable without it); omit the
comma when the clause is restrictive (identifies which specific thing is
meant).
- `[INFO]` flag each "which" clause for author review, noting whether a comma
  is present and whether it seems non-restrictive or restrictive. Do not
  auto-classify as error — this requires human judgement. `[VIBE]`

#### 4.5 Prohibited words and phrases

Flag the following as `[WARN]`:

**Vague intensifiers** — never use these; emphasize through a shorter
sentence or a quantitative qualifier instead: `very`, `quite`, `rather`

**Overused or inflated vocabulary** — replace with simpler alternatives:
`utilize` (→ use), `emerges`, `pioneered`, `encompass`, `poised to become`,
`paramount`, `harbor`, `foster`

**Imprecise word choices** — flag the following specific substitutions as
`[WARN]`:
- `calculation` in a mathematical or algorithmic context → prefer
  `computation`. "Calculation" implies arithmetic; "computation" covers
  algorithmic processing.
- `given` as an adjective meaning "provided" (e.g., "the given trajectory") →
  prefer `provided`. ("Given an initial state, ..." as a conditional is
  acceptable.)
- `gives` meaning "produces" or "provides" (e.g., "this gives us X") → prefer
  `provides` or `yields`.
- `dynamic` as a filler adjective for anything that changes over time (e.g.,
  "dynamic human motion") → be specific; prefer "arbitrary", "time-varying",
  or "changing".
- `verifiable safety` → prefer `formal safety guarantees` or `provably safe`.
- `re-define` when extending rather than replacing (e.g., "we re-define the
  cost function") → prefer `extend` or `incorporate`.
- `use-case` (hyphenated) as a standalone noun → prefer `use case` (two
  words, no hyphen).
- `computationally intensive` → prefer `computationally expensive`.

**Possessive form**: prefer "of" over "'s" when referring to inanimate objects
or concepts (e.g., "the speed of the robot" not "the robot's speed").
Exception: proper human names (e.g., "Lyapunov's stability theorem").
- `[WARN]` for `TERM's NOUN` where TERM is a technical concept, algorithm name,
  or entity (e.g., "the agent's action" → "the action of the agent"). `[MIX]`
- `[INFO]` flag each `'s` possessive applied to a non-person noun for author
  review. `[MIX]`

#### 4.6 Quantitative claims

A quantitative result stated in prose must be immediately supported by a number
in the same sentence.
- `[WARN]` if a comparative or superlative claim appears without an
  accompanying number in the same sentence: e.g., "our method significantly
  outperforms the baseline" without a percentage, ratio, or absolute value
  following it. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if "state-of-the-art" is claimed without a citation or numeric
  comparison. `[MIX]`

#### 4.7 Compound adjectives

Compound adjectives before a noun must be hyphenated.
- `[WARN]` for common unhyphenated compound adjectives before a noun, e.g.:
  `safety critical` → `safety-critical`, `real world` → `real-world`, `long
  horizon` → `long-horizon`, `state of the art` → `state-of-the-art`, `high
  frequency` → `high-frequency`, `data driven` → `data-driven`, `end to
  end` → `end-to-end`, `high dimensional` → `high-dimensional`, `long term`
  → `long-term`, `short term` → `short-term`. `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if "soft-actor-critic" or similar algorithm names are hyphenated
  when standing alone as a noun rather than as a compound modifier before
  another noun. `[MIX]`
- `[INFO]` if a compound noun standing alone (not before another noun) is
  hyphenated unnecessarily (e.g., "use-case" as a standalone noun). `[MIX]`

#### 4.8 Overused sentence openers

- `[INFO]` if "Note that" is used more than once per section. It should be
  reserved for genuinely non-obvious implications — flag each use for author
  review. `[HARD]`
- `[INFO]` if a paragraph ends with a boilerplate closing sentence that adds no
  content (e.g., "This concludes our discussion of X.", "In summary, we have
  shown..."). These are rarely needed and often pad length. `[VIBE]`

#### 4.9 Redundancy

- `[WARN]` if the same information is conveyed twice in adjacent sentences or
  consecutive paragraphs without adding new detail. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if a figure caption repeats verbatim something already stated in the
  immediately preceding paragraph. `[VIBE]`
- `[WARN]` if numbers from a table are repeated verbatim in the text narrative
  that directly follows the table. `[VIBE]`

#### 4.10 Strong claims and unsupported statements

- `[WARN]` if a claim uses "prove", "guarantee", "ensure", or "verify" without
  a formal proof, theorem, or direct citation. Flag each occurrence and note
  the missing backing. `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if the paper states that something "cannot" be done or "is
  impossible" without a citation or proof. `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if a conclusion or result is stated as general ("in any
  environment", "for all cases") when the experiments only covered one or two
  specific settings. `[VIBE]`
- `[INFO]` if a result that is mathematically trivial is presented as a
  significant finding without qualification. `[VIBE]`

#### 4.11 Parameter values in method sections

- `[WARN]` if a specific numerical value (e.g., `200 ms`, `250 Hz`, `0.4 rad`)
  appears in the method description section rather than in the experimental
  setup section or a parameter table. Method sections should use symbolic
  parameter names (e.g., `\Delta T`, `f_{\text{shield}}`); concrete values
  belong in the experiments section. `[MIX]`
- `[WARN]` if the `siunitx` package is not used, e.g., \SI{200}{\milli
  \second}. `[HARD]`

#### 4.12 Enumeration markers

- `[WARN]` if "First, ...", "Second, ...", "Third, ..." enumeration markers are
  used when the corresponding items are more than one paragraph apart. When
  items are spread across multiple paragraphs, readers lose the thread — use
  subsections or an itemize list instead. `[MIX]`

### Check 5: Abbreviations

**Goal**: Verify that every abbreviation is introduced correctly, used
consistently, has the right article, and that the abstract is self-contained.

#### 5.1 Collect all abbreviations

Scan the full document for abbreviations. An abbreviation is any sequence of 2
or more uppercase letters (optionally mixed with digits), e.g., `RL`, `MDP`,
`SAC`, `HER`, `STP`, `DoF`. Also collect any terms defined via LaTeX acronym
packages (`\ac{}`, `\acp{}`, `\acf{}`, `\acl{}`, `\acs{}`, `\newacronym{}`).

Build two lists:
- **Abstract abbreviations**: all abbreviations appearing in the abstract
- **Body abbreviations**: all abbreviations appearing in the main body
  (everything after the abstract)

#### 5.2 Check the abstract

The abstract is a standalone piece of text and must introduce its own
abbreviations independently of the main body.

For each abbreviation in the abstract:
- `[ERROR]` if it is used without being introduced in the abstract itself
  (pattern: full term followed by abbreviation in parentheses, e.g.,
  `reinforcement learning (RL)`) `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if it is introduced more than once in the abstract `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if it is introduced in the abstract but only used once (introduction
  unnecessary) `[MIX]`

#### 5.3 Check first use in the main body

For each abbreviation in the body:
- Find the first occurrence in document order (follow `\input`/`\include`
  chain).
- `[ERROR]` if the first occurrence is bare (e.g., `RL` appears) without a
  prior or inline introduction of the form `full term (ABBREV)`. This applies
  even if the abbreviation was introduced in the abstract — the main body
  must introduce it independently. `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if the abbreviation appears in a section heading before it has been
  introduced in body text. `[HARD]`
- `[INFO]` if the introduction pattern deviates from `full term (ABBREV)`
  (e.g., abbreviation introduced before the full term). `[MIX]`

#### 5.4 Check subsequent uses in the main body

After the introduction, the full term must not be written out again — the
abbreviation must be used exclusively.

- `[WARN]` for each occurrence of the full term (case-insensitive) after the
  introduction point, where the abbreviation should have been used instead.
  `[MIX]`
- `[ERROR]` if the abbreviation is introduced more than once in the main body
  (e.g., `neural network (NN)` appears a second time after the first body
  introduction). Note: one introduction in the abstract and one in the body is
  correct and expected — this error only fires for a second introduction
  within the body itself. `[HARD]`

#### 5.5 Check article agreement

For each occurrence of `a ABBREV` or `an ABBREV` (case-insensitive), check
whether the article matches the pronunciation of the first letter of the
abbreviation as a spelled-out letter name.

Letters whose names begin with a vowel sound → require `an`: `A` (AY), `E`
(EE), `F` (EF), `H` (AY-TCH), `I` (EYE), `L` (EL), `M` (EM), `N` (EN), `O`
(OH), `R` (AR), `S` (ESS), `X` (EX)

All other letters → require `a`.

**Exception**: if the abbreviation is pronounced as a word rather than spelled
out (e.g., `NASA`, `LASER`), use the pronunciation of the word itself, not the
first letter name. Use context and common knowledge to judge this.

- `[ERROR]` if the article does not match the rule above (e.g., `a NN` →
  should be `an NN`). `[MIX]`

#### 5.6 Check plural formation

Plurals of abbreviations are formed by appending a lowercase `s` directly:
`NNs`, `MLPs`, `STPs`.

- `[ERROR]` if a possessive apostrophe is used to form a plural: `NN's`,
  `MLP's` `[HARD]`
- `[WARN]` if the full term is pluralized after the abbreviation has been
  introduced (e.g., `neural networks` instead of `NNs`) `[MIX]`

## Mode A: Report Mode (default)

After all checks are complete, produce a single report with the following
structure (see **Output Format** below). Do not edit any source files.

---

## Mode B: Interactive Mode (`--interactive`)

In interactive mode, all checks still run first to collect the full issue list.
Then present issues to the user one at a time and allow them to resolve each
before moving on.

### Interactive Loop

For each issue (ordered by check, then severity ERRORs first, then line
number):

1. **Present the issue** in a compact block:
``` Issue 3 of 17 — [ERROR] abbrev — intro.tex:42 > we use a NN to classify
Abbreviation "NN" used before introduction. Suggestion: Change to "a neural
network (NN)" on first use. ```

2. **Offer the user four options:**
``` How would you like to proceed? [A] Apply suggestion [E] Edit manually —
tell me what to write [S] Skip this issue [Q] Quit and show remaining issues as
a report ```

3. **Handle the response:**
   - `A` — apply the suggested fix directly to the source file using the Edit
     tool, confirm the change, then move to the next issue.
   - `E` — ask the user for the desired text, apply it, confirm, then move to
     the next issue.
   - `S` — mark the issue as skipped and move to the next issue.
   - `Q` — stop the interactive loop and output the remaining unresolved
     issues as a standard report (see **Output Format**).

4. After every applied edit, briefly confirm: `✓ Fixed in intro.tex:42.
   Moving to next issue.`

5. After all issues are resolved or skipped, show a short closing summary:
``` Interactive session complete. Fixed: 12 | Skipped: 3 | Remaining: 2 (see
report below) ``` Then output any skipped issues as a report.

### Important Rules for Interactive Mode

- Re-read the relevant file section before applying each edit to ensure the
  file has not drifted from the collected finding (earlier edits may shift line
  numbers).
- Never apply an edit without confirming the target text still matches. If it
  does not, re-present the finding with the updated context and ask the user
  again.
- Do not batch-apply multiple edits without user confirmation between each one.

---

## Output Format

After all checks are complete, produce a single Markdown report. Follow the
structure defined in `templates/output_template.md` exactly — use it as the
skeleton and fill in every placeholder.

### Report structure summary

1. **Header**: paper title, date, source path.
2. **Scorecard**: one row per check with separate Errors / Warnings / Info /
   Total columns.
3. **Overall Assessment** (immediately after the scorecard):
   - A 2–4 sentence paragraph on the overall quality: strongest areas and
     most critical weaknesses.
   - A **Top Issues to Address** list of the 3–6 most impactful issues across
     all checks, ordered by impact. Format: `[SEVERITY] Check N.x —
     description`. This gives the author a quick action list before reading the
     full details.
4. **Per-check sections** (one per check):
   - **Summary**: 1–2 sentences on the key findings for that check (e.g.,
     "All abbreviations are correctly introduced. However, three `a NN` article
     errors and one double introduction were found.").
   - **Findings**: individual findings in finding format (see below). Write "No
     issues found." if the check is clean.

### Finding Format

```
- [SEVERITY] file.tex:LINE — <concise description of the issue>
  > <offending snippet (≤ 80 chars)>
  Suggestion: <concrete fix>
```

Severity levels:
- `[ERROR]` — clear rule violation (e.g., abbreviation never introduced,
  undefined math symbol)
- `[WARN]` — likely issue that needs human judgement (e.g., possible
  inconsistency)
- `[INFO]` — minor style note or suggestion

Sort findings within each section by severity (ERRORs first), then by line
number.

### PDF generation

After writing the Markdown report, automatically convert it to PDF by running:

```bash
python ~/.agents/skills/proofread/scripts/generate_report_pdf.py <report.md>
```

Run this as the final step of report mode. If the script fails (missing
`pandoc` or LaTeX), print the error and note that the Markdown report is still
complete and readable. The LaTeX template is at
`~/.claude/skills/proofreading/templates/report_latex.tex`.
