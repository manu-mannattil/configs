                    CONFIGURATION NOTES

1. Warnings of the following type

      An improperly formatted directive with head ... was
      encountered...

   is indicative of a syntax error in either FrontEnd/init.m
   or Kernel/init.m.  In particular, in FrontEnd/init.m make
   sure that the last item in the argument list of
   SetOptions[...] is _not_ followed by a comma.

2. Keybindings can be customized by changing MenuSetup.tr
   and KeyEventsTranslations.tr.  But the former has
   precedence over the latter.

3. The default MenuSetup.tr and KeyEventsTranslations.tr can be found
   by inspecting the installation directory, usually under

      .../path/to/installation/SystemFiles/FrontEnd/TextResources/X/

4. Meta modifiers for menu items can be removed by removing
   the ampersands (&) from the menu names in MenuSetup.tr.
   For example, to remove the M-r shortcut for Format,
   replace Menu["Fo&rmat", ...] with Menu["Format", ...]


                 EMACS-INSPIRED KEYBINDINGS

I would've preferred vi-style keybindings, but modal editing
is hard to emulate, so I've settled for Emacs-style bindings
instead.  Also, I've stripped the meta modifiers of all the
menu items from my MenuSetup.tr since I don't use them and
to avoid needless conflicts.

Following Emacs notation, C-x is Ctrl+X; M-x is usually
Alt+X; S-x is Shift+X; and C-M-x is Ctrl+Alt+X, etc.  Also,
DEL is the "backspace" key, and not the "delete" key.

MOVING COMMANDS

  The following moving commands are completely analogous to
  their Emacs counterparts:

      C-f     move one character forward
      M-f     move forward to next word
      C-b     move one character backward
      M-b     move backward to previous word
      C-n     move to next line
      C-p     move to previous line
      C-a     move to beginning of line
      C-e     move to end of line

  Somewhat analogous commands:

      M-p     move page up
      M-n     move page down

      C-M-f   move to next expression
      C-M-b   move to previous expression

  The following moving commands have been inspired by Vim's
  } and { motion commands and Emacs's M-} and M-{ keys to
  move forward/backward by paragraphs:

      C-]     move to next cell
      C-[     move to previous cell

EDITING COMMANDS

  The following commands are somewhat analogous to their
  Emacs counterparts:

      C-k     delete current cell

  Completely analogous commands:

      DEL     delete one character backward
      C-D     delete one character forward
      M-DEL   delete one word backward
      M-D     delete one word forward

MISCELLANEOUS

      M-/     search (i.e., find)
      C-;     comment/uncomment selection
      C-S-.   select all (cf. C-. to extend selection)
